# (De)clarative CLI

Purpose of DECLI is to simplify parsing complex CLI arguments and defining rich CLI tools with minimal amount of required code.

DECLI builds on top of [cli](https://gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v2). It relies heavily on defining CLI parameters as field tags in Golang structs instead of programmatically defining the arguments using Go code.
